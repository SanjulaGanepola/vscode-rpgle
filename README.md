Adds functionality to assist in writing accurate, readable and consistent RPGLE, including:

* Content assist
* Outline view
* Linter, including indentation checking and reformatting (`**FREE` only)
* Column assist for fixed-format RPGLE.

Depends on the Code for IBM i extension due to source code living on the remote system when developing with source members.
